Time Series Forecasting with Automated Model Selection

## Introduction

The world is generating an immense amount of data every day, and one of the most common types of data is time series data. Time series data consists of observations taken sequentially over time, and it is used in various fields like finance, weather forecasting, and manufacturing. However, forecasting and detecting anomalies in such data is a challenging task that requires specialized models.

The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent system for time series forecasting and anomaly detection. Specifically, we aim to:
- **Select the best time series model**: This involves creating a classifier that predicts the best forecasting model for a given time series based on the dataset's characteristics.
- **Generate predictions**: Once the best model is chosen, it will be used to generate forecasts for the given data, along with the calculation of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to evaluate performance.
- **Anomaly Detection**: By forecasting future values and comparing them to actual observations, we can identify anomalies in time series data that deviate significantly from the expected trend.

This solution is built to work at scale, providing automated insights for business users by using different forecasting models and evaluating them based on their accuracy.
